# CrypTool.sh

A little script I threw together to help streamline the process of encrypting drives, mounting them, and un-mounting them.

## Getting Started

All you need to do to use this script is have a Linux device with the cryptsetup package installed

### Prerequisites

cryptsetup

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cryptsetup
```

### Installing

You can download the cryptool.sh file and run it directly or you can use git to copy the entire package

```

git clone https://github.com/superadm1n/cryptool
```
